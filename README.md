# Hygee Sound

Calm down now with the gentle sounds of Brown Noise, made from 100% pure, organic, home grown Math!

This is not an mp3 recording of Brown Noise, so you don't have to deal with skips when the track loops. Play it foever.

No ads. Just pure, relaxing noise. Like the ocean waves or pouring rain - Outside rain. Not rain you have to be in. The good rain.

Tune out the sounds of the city, that car alarm, or loud people using the power or mathematics. Tune out the world. Drown out your tinnitus. 

Open source code, so you can [see for yourself](https://github.com/erickveil/CalmSound). 

Built with ultra-cool new MVI architecture, so you can rotate your screen without losing context and interrupting things, or causing any of those pesky memory leaks.

Now supports both dark AND light theme phone settings, for those of you who inexplicably prefer the Android Light Theme. I don't get it, but I got you.
